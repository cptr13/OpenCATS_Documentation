This is a new documentation effort for OpenCATS.  May 2016


Please contact me at opencatsdocs  gmail dot com

Suggestions, comments, criticisms, etc are all welcome!



Building it with the Sphinx documentation system http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/

Compiled from all existing documentation.

This is VERY early and not even close to complete, so bear with me please.
