F.A.Q. for OpenCATS applicant tracking system
=============================================

**Where can I try a demo version of OpenCATS?**

We have a fully functional demo running at: `OpenCATS Demo <http://demo.opencats.org>`_   

This will allow you to test out the functionality, but will not allow you administrative rights/access.

**What operating systems and environments will openCATS work with?**

Any? We have install documentation and videos for Windows, various Linux distributions, and shared-hosting environments.  

It will work on a MAC, Amazon EC2, a VPS, in Docker, heck, you can throw it on an OS-installed thumb drive and take it with you.  I've also run it on a Synology NAS, so that's an option too.  

OpenCATS can run on pretty much anything.

**What's the catch?  Is it really free?**

YES!  That's what open-source software is.  If you're not familiar with open source software, have a read about it here: `Open Source software <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software>`_ 

This is not freemium, there are no paid tiers, and no sales person will ever call you.  This is open source software.  Having said that, OpenCATS is a little lighter on features compared to the paid ATS's out there.  Use it, enjoy, tell your friends.

**Is is accessible over the internet?**

If you want it to be, yes.  If you don't, then it doesn't have to be.  Basically, if you set it up on your local computer, it will be for that computer only.  If you set it up so that's it is accessible on your network, or the internet, then it will be accesible on your network or over the internet and you can have as many users as you need.

**What are the installation requirements for OpenCATS?**

OpenCATS is L/WAMP software, so it requires Apache, MySQL/MariaDB and PHP to run.  The specifics depend on the environment you want to install it on.  See the installation instructions for more information.

**Where is the documentation for OpenCATS?**

You are looking at it!  But in the event this is printed and handed to a recruiter in the remote desert some day, our documentation site is at: http://opencats-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

**Can I backup and restore OpenCATS?**

Absolutely.  There are a few different ways to do this, including a GUI (non-technical) backup/restore.  This is on the "to do" list for the documentation.
